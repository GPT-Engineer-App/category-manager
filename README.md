# category-manager

I want an internal app for managing categories. 

The table should list the different categories: catheggory -3 all the way to cathegory 7 (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2....)

Each cathegory has: 
- A bottom and top  threshold expressed in cost (create random values for these thresholds)
- Portions size (select between size 1, size 2.... all theway to 6) 
- Company (select between between Adam Mattkasse, Godlevert, Linas)
- Sales price (use random values here)

The user should be able to create, update and delete the categories. Make sure I can take all the above actions.
